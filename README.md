_This Javascript application takes a users age in Earth years and converts it into their age on four different planets in our solar system: Mercury, Venus, Mars, and Jupiter. It also takes an estimate of the users lifespan that they provide and returns how many more years they can expect to live on each of those planets. Finally, if a user has outlived their life expectancy, the application will return the number of years past their life expectancy that they have lived on each of the planets._
